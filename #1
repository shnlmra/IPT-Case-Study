1. Define the variables x and y as lists of numbers:
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
y = [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] 
z = (21, 22, 23, 24, 25) 

a. What is the value of 3*x? 
- The value of 3*x is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

b. What is the value of x+y? 
- The value of x+y is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]`.

c. What is the value of x-y?
- The value of x-y is not possible because subtraction between lists is not defined.

d. What is the value of x[1]?
- The value of x[1] is `2`.

e. What is the value of x[0]?
- The value of x[0] is `1`.

f. What is the value of x[-1]?
- The value of x[-1] is `5`.

g. What is the value of x[:]?
- The value of x[:] is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which means it's a copy of the entire list.

h. What is the value of x[2:4]?
- The value of x[2:4] is `[3, 4]`.

i. What is the value of x[1:4:2]?
- The value of x[1:4:2] is `[2, 4]`, which means it starts at index 1, ends at index 4 (exclusive), and steps by 2.

j. What is the value of x[:2]?
- The value of x[:2] is `[1, 2]`, which means it starts from the beginning and goes up to index 2 (exclusive)

k. What is the value of x[::2]?
- The value of x[::2] is `[1, 3, 5]`, which means it starts from the beginning, goes to the end, and steps by 2.

l. What is the result of the following two expressions? 1. x[3]=8  2. print x
- For the expression `x[3]=8`, it sets the value at index 3 of list x to be 8. So, after this operation, x becomes `[1, 2, 3, 8, 5]`. The second expression `print x` would print the modified list x, which is `[1, 2, 3, 8, 5]`.
