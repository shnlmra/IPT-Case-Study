#4. Write a program that asks the user to enter size of list and input a list of integers. Do the following: 
#a. Print the sum of items in the list. 
List = input (“Enter as many numbers as you like:”)
print (“The sum of the list is: “, len(List))

#b. Print the last item in the list.
List = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print (“the list is:”, list)
print (“the last number in the list is:”, List.pop()) 
#Outcome: 5

#c. Print the list in reverse order. 
List = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print (“the list is:”, List)
List.reverse()
print (“The list in reverse is:”, List)
#Outcome: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

#d. Print Yes if the list contains a 5 and No otherwise. 
List = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
if 5 in List
    print (“Yes, there is a Number 5”)
else
    print (“No, there is no Number 5”)
#Outcome: Yes, there is a Number 5

#e. Print how many integers in the list are less than 5. 
List = [1,2,3,4,5]
for int in List:
    if int < 5:
        print("Integers less than 5 in the list:", int)
#Outcome:
#Integers less than 5 in the list: 1
#Integers less than 5 in the list: 2
#Integers less than 5 in the list: 3
#Integers less than 5 in the list: 4

#f. Remove the first and last items from the list, sort the remaining items, and print the result.
List = [1,2,3,4,5]
print (“The list is:”, List)
List.remove (5); List.remove (1)
print (“List after removing the first and last item and sorting it out is:”, sorted(List))
#Outcome: 
#The list is: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#List after removing the first and last item and sorting it out is: [2, 3, 4]
